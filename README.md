NYC Taxi Trip Insights
Project Overview
This project applies machine learning and big data analytics to NYC taxi trip records, building predictive models for trip duration, fare amounts, demand forecasting, and passenger behavior. Using PySpark and SparkML, the system processes millions of trip records to provide comprehensive transportation insights.
Course: Applied Big Data Analytics - GWU
Dataset: NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Records
Time Period: 6 months of assigned data 

Key Features
1. Demand Forecasting

Geospatial analysis identifying high-demand taxi regions

Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models
Feature engineering using pickup/dropoff locations and timestamps

3. Passenger Segmentation

K-means clustering based on trip characteristics
Segmentation by distance, fare, time of day, and payment method
5 distinct passenger behavior groups identified 

4. Payment Type Classification

Binary classification predicting card vs. cash payment
Logistic Regression and Random Forest implementations

5. Fare Prediction Models

Borough-specific fare prediction using location features
Analysis of fare variation across NYC boroughs

6. Tip Amount Prediction

Regression models predicting tip based on trip characteristics
